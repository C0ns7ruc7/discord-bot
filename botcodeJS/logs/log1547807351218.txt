[backstory]: Spinning `Ubergrad`(Spingrad)

_once upon a time, a certain `Molten` created madman, made for eradicating gods and so-called 'devine' decided to randomly mess around with a country using a randomly picked method of torment, in this case it was `Ubergrad`, a unlucky empire who was just minding its own business. the method what the torment was "moving ground", `the Joker`(sometimes referred under similar names or as `The Exiled` by the `Molten` themselves) then made this happen to `Ubergrad`, constantly, day and night.

the ores were formed into machinery, the ground was split apart with precision, the water flowed down under the plates and as the heat flowed  into the machines the "plates" started to turn... and turn they did, now the capital is the only city in the world to face the west, north and east coast of its borders on a given day.

after much deliberation they made a drill machine dig down into one of the plates, after a long time(several KM's) they made their way into a machine room... the place was covered in darkness and everything in the unseen space was moving with cogs and gears, moving bands of metal and steel... the expedition eventually made their way into the center where there was a control hub, they did so however at a cost of losing many limbs, no casualties, and a loss of sanity for a few of them. the plate they were on was stopped only after the creator of them showed up to rave and rant and decided to stop it himself._
