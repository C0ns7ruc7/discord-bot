Ok first up i'm still being made so, be gentle... 

- I have `Ping`, `pong`, `bing`, `bong`, `ree`, `scream`, `beep` and `boop` they are what they are, use em an I will come back at you >=) 
- then I have the `say` {msg} comand, it makes me repeat you... I don't know why that is here. 
- I also keep track of `lore` [lore name] things, do a empty command for a list. 
- you can add things with `addlore` {[first word is key] the rest, explaining stuf} 
- remove lore with `rmvlore` to get rid of it(wip). 
- there is also the `mail` [#channel(or when in DM a number)] {msg}  where you can send to a channel 
- a functional command is the `whatis` [@user/role OR #channel], it shows you the number needed for DM'ing using the mail function 
- I also have the `roll` command, it works as a automatic 2d6 if you don't add comments 
- then there is the `die` command that can shut me down.
there are a bunch of other things in the works 
don't forget I use `$`'s to react Evt: [object Object]
