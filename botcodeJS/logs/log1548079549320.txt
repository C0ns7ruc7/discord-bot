Act zero: `Yalis` detonated a magic nuke in the `Royal Empire`, completely wiping out a city and making two heavily damaged, `yalis` was deemed is public enemy number one by some, but as a result the ground was sufficiantly disturbed to wake `the worm`.

Act one: the emerging of a 400km tall metal `worm` that is on fire, four fleets go to investigate, only a few ships returned, its heat output caused a semi permanent hurricane and the movements require remapping of the world.

Act two: the worm moves and makes a giant hole in `Zarkonia`, swarms of metal orbs with limbs roam `zarkonia` airspace, world is uneasy but not much is going on, ends with `Tickwork` sending `blind cult`ists to lock it up, they succeed, barely, `Zarkonia` was turned into volcanic rubble as a result and hundreds of thousands of `Orb`s were left behind.

Act three: the left behind monster `Orb`s mutated, reproduce and made the entire `Zarkonian` continent into a metallic biome of trees, animal and Living rocks, various empires probe it, and half monster human hybrids show up, they start a church under the name of `The Molten Church` and eventually form a nation under the name of `Ecclesiocracy of Orichalchum`.

several monster factions form, some being giant eyebals with limbs, other consiting of spides and human spidertuars, not all are lead by humans but by living mountains of steel. most act from the shadows.

Act four: entire biome bunched up into a single tree, tree is a capital, factions become very public about themselves internally and there is a hemogenizing that happens and then splintering of ideals and culture internally

Act five: the tree shoots into space, prompted by impending collapse of the planet of cuase by factors such as the opening of other paralel dimensions. the settle on another planet to figure things out. the main planet, `Terra`, still has fragments running around
