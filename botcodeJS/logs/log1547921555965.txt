"According to folk myth and legend deciphered from machine written texts, the tale of the Isle of Lancre involves a crescent shaped land-mass with blue green grass, home to only one individual. The Nobody. The texts describe his face as being unable to be remembered, and the black raven which accompanies him is theorized by the original authors to be one of Death's manifestations. One sunny afternoon, the Nobody activates some sort of hidden device within the island, speculated by mythologists to be either magical or some sort of incredibly complex clockwork. The work states that: "Upon the 17th minute of the 17th hour, Lancre rose upon 7 slender, bronze legs to journey the sea, never to be seen again." Topography maps have confirmed a deep depression in the Southern Sea matching Lancre's supposed shape, although the entire island is missing from all maps and witnesses are none. The identity of The Nobody appears to be an extremely dangerous and highly secret bit of knowledge, as many an informant was killed by unknown means after giving us a section of text. All that remains to be found out is the identity of the raven, the man, and the location of this legendary landmass." Evt: [object Object]
